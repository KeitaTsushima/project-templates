# PLAN: [Feature Name]

## Goals

### What are we trying to achieve?
[Describe the goal clearly - what and why]

### Success Criteria
[How will we know we're done?]

## Context

**For new features:**
- User requirements
- Use cases
- Dependencies

**For refactoring/fixes:**
- Current state analysis
- Affected files: `path/to/file.ts` (lines X-Y)
- Current behavior
- Problems with current approach

## Proposed Solution

### High-Level Approach
[Describe the solution conceptually]

### Why This Approach?
[Rationale for choosing this architecture/design]
- [Reason 1: e.g., "Maintains backwards compatibility"]
- [Reason 2: e.g., "Simplifies testing with dependency injection"]
- [Alternatives considered and why they were rejected]

### Key Components
1. **Component A**: [Purpose and responsibility]
2. **Component B**: [Purpose and responsibility]
3. **Component C**: [Purpose and responsibility]

### Architecture/Design Patterns
[Any architectural decisions or patterns being introduced]

## Implementation Steps

1. **Step 1: [Name]**
   - Create/modify: `file/path.ts`
   - Add: [specific changes]
   - Why: [rationale]

2. **Step 2: [Name]**
   - Modify: `another/file.ts`
   - Change: [specific modifications]
   - Why: [rationale]

3. **Step 3: [Name]**
   - [Continue with numbered, sequential steps]

4. **Step 4: Testing**
   - Verify: [what to test]
   - Expected: [expected behavior]

## Testing Strategy

### Unit Tests
- Test A: [what to verify]
- Test B: [what to verify]

### Integration Tests
- Scenario 1: [end-to-end flow]
- Scenario 2: [edge case]

### Manual Testing
- [ ] Test case 1
- [ ] Test case 2
- [ ] Test case 3

## Open Questions

1. [Question about approach or implementation]
2. [Uncertainty about edge case]
3. [Need for clarification on requirements]

## Success Criteria

- [ ] [Criterion 1]
- [ ] [Criterion 2]
- [ ] [Criterion 3]
- [ ] All tests passing
- [ ] Code reviewed and approved

## Issues Encountered and Resolved
